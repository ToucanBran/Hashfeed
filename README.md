<i>Instagram Picture Scraper</i>

For my wedding, I wanted a way to let our guests be the photographers and have their work shown off. This project's main goal is to provide a way of gathering recent Instagram photos with a certain hashtag and displaying them in slideshow format.

# Side note

Restrictions in Instagram's api limits the freedom in any application I develop. These rules make it so my program could only access posts from authorized users (I believe the max is 10). Because of the limitations with the api and the size of my event, I had to use other methods of gathering media, so use this at your own risk.
